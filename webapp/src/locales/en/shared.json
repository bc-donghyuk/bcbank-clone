The yield rate is determined by the volume of transactions and the volume of liquidity provided from LPs. Assuming equal trading volume every month, the LPs will earn more when less liquidity is available. The LPs will earn less when more liquidity is available. The market condition will result change in value of the principle. Since every coin has its market value, the market condition will change the value of the principal investment.
