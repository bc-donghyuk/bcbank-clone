The Company shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from the failure to recognize the risks associated with using the Service or using Digital Assets.\n\nBy depositing, a Member enters into a contract to use the Service and agrees to the terms and conditions for the product. Members are recommended to check the description of the investment service in these Terms and note the following when using the Haru Investment Service:\n\nMembers can transfer Digital Assets to their investment products and receive deposit revenue.\nThe Digital Assets deposited in this product are transferred to a cold wallet managed by the Company, transferred to external partners verified by Haru, and used for trading and operation.\nReturn on investment fluctuates depending on the operating performance of the investment asset and we do not commit to a specific rate of return.\nThis product has the risk of losing principal, and previous operating results do not guarantee future profits.\nThe information used in the description and guidance of this product is based on reliable data, but its accuracy and completeness are not guaranteed.\nMembers are subscribed to the product by the end of the coming quarter as of the date of deposit and can extend their subscription period through the Auto-Renewal function.\nReturn on investment will be paid within 5 business days after the product expiration date.\nIn the event of a return of more than 15% per year as of the maturity date, this product shall incur a performance fee of 15% of the total investment return (based on the number of Digital Assets) at the time of expiration of the product.\nThe fee for using the product will be notified at the time of product subscription but may change depending on the operational situation afterward.\nMembers are not allowed to withdraw deposit assets during the subscription period agreed at the time of product subscription, nor to drop out of product subscription within the product subscription period contracted by the Members.\nThe Digital Assets deposited by a Member when signing up for the product are automatically transferred to Haru Wallet after the payment date of the principal and interest of this product. It is not allowed to withdraw directly from Explore products to an external electronic wallet.\nHaru reserves the right to stop or terminate the investment service.\nUnless the law requires prior notice, we reserve the right to temporarily or permanently remove online access and restrict access to Haru products, including but not limited to restricting the use of Haru products and/or closing Haru products without prior notice.

However, the Company may limit or stop all or part of the Service:\nIf there are uncontrollable reasons like force majeure including but not limited to war, rebellion, natural disasters, or national emergency;\nIf normal Service is disrupted for reasons including power outage, failure of facilities, or excessive server load;\nIf there are unavoidable circumstances due to construction including but not limited to repair of service equipment;\nIf the Service cannot be otherwise provided due to various circumstances of the Company.\nThe Company shall not be liable for any problems arising from the change or suspension of the Services unless the Service has been changed or suspended due to the Company’s intention or gross negligence.\nIn the event of a problem caused by the Company’s gross negligence, the Company shall compensate for damage caused by such negligence up to the limit of the Company’s assets. Regarding compensation for damages, all claims shall be made against the Company, and shall not extend to other individuals or organizations, including Service Members, affiliates, investors, employees, officers, agents, or advisors.
